For Herman Zimmerman and all his talented artist and designers in the Deep Space Nine Art Department who took ""a strange, intriguing object in orbit of Bajor"" and made it the best-looking series on television.

There is linear in the nonlinear, so that neither exists one without the other. So it was with ANSLEM, and all the multitudes that he held within himself, myself among them, in that place that was no place, obtained only by knowing the absence of hours in the hourglass. An hourglass as the entryway? Was there ever such a joke to make even a Vulcan laugh at those immensities and contradictions of meaning? Yet caught in that sea of sand, drawn toward the neck of that hourglass where both the Temples at last were aligned-well, what else could we do in those vast temporal currents but race time....

To Denise & Mike and more adventures in the 8th dimension
For Herman Zimmerman and all his talented artists and designers in the Deep Space Nine Art Department, who took ""a strange, intriguing object in orbit of Bajor"" and made it the best-looking series on television
And last, though not least ... since before our sun burned hot in space, every writer of a Star Trek novel or nonfiction book has had an unsung partner-a heroic captain whose mission it is to keep them true to the Star Trek universe, its history, its character, and its ideals. In return, she's faced with Star Trek book writers (okay, like us) who push her unmercifully on deadlines, who grumble about her notes (especially when she's right), and who rarely share with her the bottom-line truth: she makes all of our books better. After sixteen of them, we thought it was about time to come clean.
So, with respect, appreciation, and many, many thanks, this one's for Paula Block.

In return, she's faced with Star Trek book writers (okay, like us) who push her unmercifully on deadlines, who grumble about her notes (especially when she's right), and who rarely share with her the bottom-line truth: she makes all of our books better. After sixteen of them, we thought it was about time to come clean.
So, with respect, appreciation, and many, many thanks, this one's for Paula Block.

For Herman Zimmerman and all his talented artists and designers in the Deep Space Nine Art Department, who took ""a strange, intriguing object in orbit of Bajor"" and made it the best-looking series on television
And last, though not least ... since before our sun burned hot in space, every writer of a Star Trek novel or nonfiction book has had an unsung partner-a heroic captain whose mission it is to keep them true to the Star Trek universe, its history, its character, and its ideals. In return, she's faced with Star Trek book writers (okay, like us) who push her unmercifully on deadlines, who grumble about her notes (especially when she's right), and who rarely share with her the bottom-line truth: she makes all of our books better. After sixteen of them, we thought it was about time to come clean.
So, with respect, appreciation, and many, many thanks, this one's for Paula Block.

For Herman Zimmerman and all his talented artists and designers in the Deep Space Nine Art Department, who took ""a strange, intriguing object in orbit of Bajor"" and made it the best-looking series on television
And last, though not least ... since before our sun burned hot in space, every writer of a Star Trek novel or nonfiction book has had an unsung partner-a heroic captain whose mission it is to keep them true to the Star Trek universe, its history, its character, and its ideals. In return, she's faced with Star Trek book writers (okay, like us) who push her unmercifully on deadlines, who grumble about her notes (especially when she's right), and who rarely share with her the bottom-line truth: she makes all of our books better. After sixteen of them, we thought it was about time to come clean.
So, with respect, appreciation, and many, many thanks, this one's for Paula Block.

For Gene L. Coon, who gave us our first glimpse, John Colicos, who gave us our first view, and John M. Ford, who gave us our first insight
Honor is a code set not in stone nor on parchment, but in the blood and bone of warriors, in the souls that stir in their breasts, and the actions of their daily lives. It comes from the deepest part of us, coloring our every decision. It is an instinctive knowledge of right and wrong, that while not always in agreement with the laws of the land, is always in agreement with our hearts. Without a sense of true honor, we are nothing, for we have lost our sense of self, lost that which defines us as warriors, lost that which keeps our Empire strong.

FROM MARK A. ALTMAN
To my magnificent mom, Gail, for taking me to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture when she'd rather have been anywhere else in the galaxy. At least you got to have The Mommies' Marilyn Kentz play you in a movie.
To my unforgettable dad, Michael ... for everything-and even occasionally turning off the baseball, football, hockey, and basketball games to let me watch Star Trek.
To my sensational grandfather, Seymour, for stopping and taking me to a Star Trek convention in New Jersey when he really just wanted to get home to watch the Jets game.
To my brotastic brother, Ira, for caring about sports and not Star Trek so we never competed with each other, Decker.
To my wonderful wife, Naomi, for being the most enterprising woman I know.
And my amazing kids, Ella and Isaac, who helped me get over my aversion to children after watching ""And the Children Shall Lead."" It's okay that you love the Ewoks ... really.
And, of course, Frederick S. Clarke; a mentor, a friend, and the man who made this book possible. You showed us all how it's done. Remember.
Finally, Ed Gross. Thanks for being such a nudge. I would have never written this book with you if you hadn't kept bugging me for years about it. I can't imagine doing it with anyone else.
Also special thanks to our editor extraordinaire, Brendan Deneen, for being a Deep Space Nine fan, among many other things that make him awesome.
 
FROM EDWARD GROSS
To my wife and best friend, Eileen. Over thirty years on and we're still boldly going! There's no one I'd rather be on this voyage with. Sorry this book turned you into a Star Trek widow.
To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin. I am so proud of all three of you, and thrilled beyond words that we share a love for all things geek.
To my mom, dad, sister, and brother. Thanks for all the years of nodding and smiling politely no matter how strange my obsessions seemed.
To my father, who took me to the first Star Trek convention ever in 1972. Sorry we didn't connect on much, but that was one moment when we did.
To all of the editors-among them Starlog's David McDonnell, Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, Cinescape's Douglas Perry, SFX's Dave Golder, Long Island Nightlife's Bill Ervolino, Movie Magic's Karen Williams, SciFiNow's Aaron Asadi, and Geek's David Williams-who saw something in me and my writing and helped keep the dream going for all of these years.
To my friends who have shared my love for Star Trek over the years, including John Garry, Kevin Oldham, Tom Sanders, Dexter Frank, Linda Miracco, Scott Milner, Jay Starr, Allen Lane, and Leon McKenzie.
To all of the people connected with Star Trek that I've interviewed over the decades. So many of you made it easy to once again talk Trek for this book, and it's genuinely appreciated.
To Laurie Fox and Brendan Deneen, respectively agent and editor extraordinaire, for believing in this project as much as we do.
And to Mark A. Altman. Throughout the process of writing this book, I could not imagine a better collaborator or cheerleader. It was such a joy to take this trip back to the Final Frontier with you.

To my magnificent mom, Gail, for taking me to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture when she'd rather have been anywhere else in the galaxy. At least you got to have The Mommies' Marilyn Kentz play you in a movie.
To my unforgettable dad, Michael ... for everything-and even occasionally turning off the baseball, football, hockey, and basketball games to let me watch Star Trek.
To my sensational grandfather, Seymour, for stopping and taking me to a Star Trek convention in New Jersey when he really just wanted to get home to watch the Jets game.
To my brotastic brother, Ira, for caring about sports and not Star Trek so we never competed with each other, Decker.
To my wonderful wife, Naomi, for being the most enterprising woman I know.
And my amazing kids, Ella and Isaac, who helped me get over my aversion to children after watching ""And the Children Shall Lead."" It's okay that you love the Ewoks ... really.
And, of course, Frederick S. Clarke; a mentor, a friend, and the man who made this book possible. You showed us all how it's done. Remember.
Finally, Ed Gross. Thanks for being such a nudge. I would have never written this book with you if you hadn't kept bugging me for years about it. I can't imagine doing it with anyone else.
Also special thanks to our editor extraordinaire, Brendan Deneen, for being a Deep Space Nine fan, among many other things that make him awesome.
 
FROM EDWARD GROSS
To my wife and best friend, Eileen. Over thirty years on and we're still boldly going! There's no one I'd rather be on this voyage with. Sorry this book turned you into a Star Trek widow.
To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin. I am so proud of all three of you, and thrilled beyond words that we share a love for all things geek.
To my mom, dad, sister, and brother. Thanks for all the years of nodding and smiling politely no matter how strange my obsessions seemed.
To my father, who took me to the first Star Trek convention ever in 1972. Sorry we didn't connect on much, but that was one moment when we did.
To all of the editors-among them Starlog's David McDonnell, Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, Cinescape's Douglas Perry, SFX's Dave Golder, Long Island Nightlife's Bill Ervolino, Movie Magic's Karen Williams, SciFiNow's Aaron Asadi, and Geek's David Williams-who saw something in me and my writing and helped keep the dream going for all of these years.
To my friends who have shared my love for Star Trek over the years, including John Garry, Kevin Oldham, Tom Sanders, Dexter Frank, Linda Miracco, Scott Milner, Jay Starr, Allen Lane, and Leon McKenzie.
To all of the people connected with Star Trek that I've interviewed over the decades. So many of you made it easy to once again talk Trek for this book, and it's genuinely appreciated.
To Laurie Fox and Brendan Deneen, respectively agent and editor extraordinaire, for believing in this project as much as we do.
And to Mark A. Altman. Throughout the process of writing this book, I could not imagine a better collaborator or cheerleader. It was such a joy to take this trip back to the Final Frontier with you.

To my father, who took me to the first Star Trek convention ever in 1972. Sorry we didn't connect on much, but that was one moment when we did.
To all of the editors-among them Starlog's David McDonnell, Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, Cinescape's Douglas Perry, SFX's Dave Golder, Long Island Nightlife's Bill Ervolino, Movie Magic's Karen Williams, SciFiNow's Aaron Asadi, and Geek's David Williams-who saw something in me and my writing and helped keep the dream going for all of these years.
To my friends who have shared my love for Star Trek over the years, including John Garry, Kevin Oldham, Tom Sanders, Dexter Frank, Linda Miracco, Scott Milner, Jay Starr, Allen Lane, and Leon McKenzie.
To all of the people connected with Star Trek that I've interviewed over the decades. So many of you made it easy to once again talk Trek for this book, and it's genuinely appreciated.
To Laurie Fox and Brendan Deneen, respectively agent and editor extraordinaire, for believing in this project as much as we do.
And to Mark A. Altman. Throughout the process of writing this book, I could not imagine a better collaborator or cheerleader. It was such a joy to take this trip back to the Final Frontier with you.  
FROM MARK A. ALTMAN
To my magnificent mom, Gail, for taking me to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture when she'd rather have been anywhere else in the galaxy. At least you got to have The Mommies' Marilyn Kentz play you in a movie.
To my unforgettable dad, Michael ... for everything-and even occasionally turning off the baseball, football, hockey, and basketball games to let me watch Star Trek.
To my sensational grandfather, Seymour, for stopping and taking me to a Star Trek convention in New Jersey when he really just wanted to get home to watch the Jets game.
To my brotastic brother, Ira, for caring about sports and not Star Trek so we never competed with each other, Decker.
To my wonderful wife, Naomi, for being the most enterprising woman I know.
And my amazing kids, Ella and Isaac, who helped me get over my aversion to children after watching ""And the Children Shall Lead."" It's okay that you love the Ewoks ... really.
And, of course, Frederick S. Clarke; a mentor, a friend, and the man who made this book possible. You showed us all how it's done. Remember.
Finally, Ed Gross. Thanks for being such a nudge. I would have never written this book with you if you hadn't kept bugging me for years about it. I can't imagine doing it with anyone else.
Also special thanks to our editor extraordinaire, Brendan Deneen, for being a Deep Space Nine fan, among many other things that make him awesome.

      FROM MARK A. ALTMAN
      
      To my wonderful wife, Naomi, whom I married despite the fact she likes Captain Picard
         way more than Captain Kirk. Thanks for ""tolerating"" me.... 
      
      
      To my incredible kids, Ella and Isaac, who may one day like Star Trek as much as Star Wars, but I kinda doubt it.
      
      
      To my amazing mom, Gail, who took me to see North by Northwest at the Thalia when I was a kid, beginning an obsession with movies and television
         that would last a lifetime.
      
      
      To my fabulous brother, Ira, for being way cooler than me.
      
      
      To my incredible dad, Michael, for occasionally turning off the hockey, baseball,
         tennis, golf, and football games so I could watch Star Trek.
      
      To our charming cats, Ripley, Giles, and Willow, for staying off my Mac keyboard while
         I wrote these books ... most of the time.
      
      
      To Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, for proving there was a place for intelligent entertainment
         journalism about the genre and giving me the incredible opportunity that led to the
         creation of this book.
      
      
      Ditto to my own Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant and inspirational Thomas Doherty.
      
      Also a final nod of gratitude to the late Larry Goldman, one of the founders of the
         PR firm Bender, Goldman & Helper, who, for reasons I continue to find unfathomable,
         received a query letter from a young college student and invited him and his college
         roommate to Los Angeles to tour the sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987-which began a thirty-year journey that led to the writing of this book-and
         bought lunch at the commissary to boot.
      
      
      And to three other people without whom this book would not be possible: Edward Gross,
         my incredible partner in crime, who truly is the hardest-working man in showbiz; the
         jocular bard of book publishing, Brendan Deneen, our editor and enthusiast-in-chief;
         and, last and certainly not least, the late, great Gene Roddenberry, without whom
         there would be no starship Enterprise A, B, C or bloody D.
      
      
       
      
       
      
      FROM EDWARD GROSS
      
      To Eileen, my best friend who also happens to be my wife: I can't remember a time
         when I was on this voyage without you, and I would never want to.
      
      
      To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin (all of whom have inherited the geek gene): I
         don't know how I could be as blessed as I am to have three children who have turned
         into such fine men. I'm grateful for all of you.
      
      
      To my daughter-in-law, Lindsay: Welcome to the family. We couldn't be happier. And
         thanks for being a geek, too.

      FROM EDWARD GROSS
      
      To Eileen, my best friend who also happens to be my wife: I can't remember a time
         when I was on this voyage without you, and I would never want to.
      
      
      To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin (all of whom have inherited the geek gene): I
         don't know how I could be as blessed as I am to have three children who have turned
         into such fine men. I'm grateful for all of you.
      
      
      To my daughter-in-law, Lindsay: Welcome to the family. We couldn't be happier. And
         thanks for being a geek, too.  
      
      FROM MARK A. ALTMAN
      
      To my wonderful wife, Naomi, whom I married despite the fact she likes Captain Picard
         way more than Captain Kirk. Thanks for ""tolerating"" me.... 
      
      
      To my incredible kids, Ella and Isaac, who may one day like Star Trek as much as Star Wars, but I kinda doubt it.
      
      
      To my amazing mom, Gail, who took me to see North by Northwest at the Thalia when I was a kid, beginning an obsession with movies and television
         that would last a lifetime.
      
      
      To my fabulous brother, Ira, for being way cooler than me.
      
      
      To my incredible dad, Michael, for occasionally turning off the hockey, baseball,
         tennis, golf, and football games so I could watch Star Trek.
      
      To our charming cats, Ripley, Giles, and Willow, for staying off my Mac keyboard while
         I wrote these books ... most of the time.
      
      
      To Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, for proving there was a place for intelligent entertainment
         journalism about the genre and giving me the incredible opportunity that led to the
         creation of this book.
      
      
      Ditto to my own Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant and inspirational Thomas Doherty.
      
      Also a final nod of gratitude to the late Larry Goldman, one of the founders of the
         PR firm Bender, Goldman & Helper, who, for reasons I continue to find unfathomable,
         received a query letter from a young college student and invited him and his college
         roommate to Los Angeles to tour the sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987-which began a thirty-year journey that led to the writing of this book-and
         bought lunch at the commissary to boot.
      
      
      And to three other people without whom this book would not be possible: Edward Gross,
         my incredible partner in crime, who truly is the hardest-working man in showbiz; the
         jocular bard of book publishing, Brendan Deneen, our editor and enthusiast-in-chief;
         and, last and certainly not least, the late, great Gene Roddenberry, without whom

         roommate to Los Angeles to tour the sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987-which began a thirty-year journey that led to the writing of this book-and
         bought lunch at the commissary to boot.

         and, last and certainly not least, the late, great Gene Roddenberry, without whom

      To Eileen, my best friend who also happens to be my wife: I can't remember a time
         when I was on this voyage without you, and I would never want to.
      
      
      To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin (all of whom have inherited the geek gene): I
         don't know how I could be as blessed as I am to have three children who have turned
         into such fine men. I'm grateful for all of you.
      
      
      To my daughter-in-law, Lindsay: Welcome to the family. We couldn't be happier. And
         thanks for being a geek, too.

      To my fabulous brother, Ira, for being way cooler than me.
      
      
      To my incredible dad, Michael, for occasionally turning off the hockey, baseball,
         tennis, golf, and football games so I could watch Star Trek.
      
      To our charming cats, Ripley, Giles, and Willow, for staying off my Mac keyboard while
         I wrote these books ... most of the time.

      Ditto to my own Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant and inspirational Thomas Doherty.

      To Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, for proving there was a place for intelligent entertainment
         journalism about the genre and giving me the incredible opportunity that led to the
         creation of this book.
      
      
      Ditto to my own Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant and inspirational Thomas Doherty.
      
      Also a final nod of gratitude to the late Larry Goldman, one of the founders of the
         PR firm Bender, Goldman & Helper, who, for reasons I continue to find unfathomable,
         received a query letter from a young college student and invited him and his college
         roommate to Los Angeles to tour the sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987-which began a thirty-year journey that led to the writing of this book-and
         bought lunch at the commissary to boot.
      
      
      And to three other people without whom this book would not be possible: Edward Gross,
         my incredible partner in crime, who truly is the hardest-working man in showbiz; the
         jocular bard of book publishing, Brendan Deneen, our editor and enthusiast-in-chief;
         and, last and certainly not least, the late, great Gene Roddenberry, without whom
         there would be no starship Enterprise A, B, C or bloody D.

      To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin (all of whom have inherited the geek gene): I
         don't know how I could be as blessed as I am to have three children who have turned
         into such fine men. I'm grateful for all of you.

      To my amazing mom, Gail, who took me to see North by Northwest at the Thalia when I was a kid, beginning an obsession with movies and television
         that would last a lifetime.
      
      
      To my fabulous brother, Ira, for being way cooler than me.
      
      
      To my incredible dad, Michael, for occasionally turning off the hockey, baseball,
         tennis, golf, and football games so I could watch Star Trek.
      
      To our charming cats, Ripley, Giles, and Willow, for staying off my Mac keyboard while
         I wrote these books ... most of the time.
      
      
      To Cinefantastique's Frederick S. Clarke, for proving there was a place for intelligent entertainment
         journalism about the genre and giving me the incredible opportunity that led to the
         creation of this book.
      
      
      Ditto to my own Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant and inspirational Thomas Doherty.
      
      Also a final nod of gratitude to the late Larry Goldman, one of the founders of the
         PR firm Bender, Goldman & Helper, who, for reasons I continue to find unfathomable,
         received a query letter from a young college student and invited him and his college
         roommate to Los Angeles to tour the sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987-which began a thirty-year journey that led to the writing of this book-and
         bought lunch at the commissary to boot.
      
      
      And to three other people without whom this book would not be possible: Edward Gross,
         my incredible partner in crime, who truly is the hardest-working man in showbiz; the
         jocular bard of book publishing, Brendan Deneen, our editor and enthusiast-in-chief;
         and, last and certainly not least, the late, great Gene Roddenberry, without whom
         there would be no starship Enterprise A, B, C or bloody D.
      
      
       
      
       
      
      FROM EDWARD GROSS
      
      To Eileen, my best friend who also happens to be my wife: I can't remember a time
         when I was on this voyage without you, and I would never want to.
      
      
      To my sons, Teddy, Dennis, and Kevin (all of whom have inherited the geek gene): I
         don't know how I could be as blessed as I am to have three children who have turned
         into such fine men. I'm grateful for all of you.
      
      
      To my daughter-in-law, Lindsay: Welcome to the family. We couldn't be happier. And
         thanks for being a geek, too.
